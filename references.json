    "abstract": "Genome assemblies provide a powerful basis of comparative multi-omics analyses that offer insight into parasite pathogenicity, host-parasite interactions, and invasion biology. As a unique intracellular nematode, consists of two clades, encapsulated and non-encapsulated. Genomic correlation of the distinct differences between the two clades is still unclear. Here, we report an annotated draft reference genome of non-encapsulated , , and perform comparative multi-omics analyses with encapsulated . Genome and methylome analyses indicate that, during evolution, the two clades of exhibit differential expansion and methylation of parasitism-related multi-copy gene families, especially for the DNase II members of the phospholipase D superfamily and Glutathione S-transferases. Further, methylome and transcriptome analyses revealed divergent key excretory/secretory (E/S) genes between the two clades. Among these key E/S genes, TP12446 is significantly more expressed across three life stages in . Overexpression of TP12446 in the mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line could induce inhibition of myotube formation and differentiation, further indicating its key role in parasitism of . This multi-omics study provides a foundation for further elucidation of the mechanism of nurse cell formation and immunoevasion, as well as the identification of pharmacological and diagnostic targets of trichinellosis.",

## De Novo Genome Assembly {.page_break_before}

### Premise:
Currently the best genome assemblies for *Trichinella spiralis* are at ~98% complete depending upon the species, mostly using Illumina and a few used PacBio RSII (ick). We plan to use Oxford Nanopore for ultra long reads assembly to further complete the genome, possibly incorporate some Illumina for hybrid correction. 

- Also look at methlyation of ONT reads?

### Target information
- Genome size: ~50-65Mb
- 3 Chromosomes

One flowcell would generate ~100-200X coverage raw. 

### Protocols
#### Extraction/Size selection
Recent PacBio paper [@10.1038/s42003-021-01650-z] simply used phenol/chloroform extraction followed by Covaris G-tube.
Previous papers [@10.1038/ncomms10513;@10.1038/ng.769] for Illumina sequencing appear to use classic Qiagen or phenol/chloroform as well.

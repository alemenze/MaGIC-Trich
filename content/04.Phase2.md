## De Novo Transcriptome {.page_break_before}

### Premise:
Annotation of genes can be done in several ways- one of which is pure computational prediction. Since *T. spiralis* is eukaryotic- we cant exclude alternative splicing playing a role here as well, which Im not sure anyone else has looked at yet. Nanopore direct RNA-sequencing will capture spliceforms and improve genome annotation. 

### Target information
- 15k-20k genes/transcripts per genome
- Primarily should be polyA+

Go after non-polyA too?

### Protocols
#### Extraction/Size selection
TBD polyA tagging of non-polyA RNAs.
**Requires >500ng polyA+ RNA for direct nanopore sequencing**

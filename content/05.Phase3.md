## Vesicle RNA {.page_break_before}

### Premise:
The crux of this project- *T. spiralis* transcripts have been found in vesicles, leading to immune modulation and neuronal alterations. Believed to be to benefit the worm, but also providing benefits to autoimmune and neurodegradation disorders. By using the stronger genome/transcriptome, we can try to identify the collection of transcripts in vesicles. 

### Target information


### Protocols
#### Extraction/Size selection
TBD polyA tagging of non-polyA RNAs.
**Requires >500ng polyA+ RNA for direct nanopore sequencing**
